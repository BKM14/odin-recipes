        <p>Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet Indian dish of paneer, originating in Delhi, in which the gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan),
            tomatoes and cashews. Spices such as red chili powder and garam masala are also used to prepare this gravy.
